Here are some basic problems involving for loops in Python:

1. Printing a sequence of numbers:
Print numbers from 1 to 10.
Print even numbers between 1 and 20.
Print numbers from 1 to 100 with a step of 3. 

2. Calculating sums:
Calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to a given number.
Calculate the sum of all odd numbers within a given range.
Calculate the sum of elements in a list. 

3. Working with lists:
Print all elements of a list.
Find the largest or smallest element in a list.
Count how many times a specific element appears in a list.

4. String manipulation:
Print each character of a string.
Reverse a string.
Count the number of digits and letters in a string.

5. Multiplication tables:
Print the multiplication table for a given number.

6. Pattern printing:
Print a square pattern of asterisks.
Print a right triangle pattern of asterisks.

7. Conditional logic within loops:
Print numbers divisible by 3 or 5 from 1 to 20.
Count the number of even and odd numbers in a series.
Check if a number is prime. 

8. Nested loops:
Use nested loops to iterate through a 2D structure.
Use nested loops to create complex patterns.
